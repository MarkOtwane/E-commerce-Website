E-Commerce Platform with Multi-User Roles

This is a PHP & MySQL-based eCommerce website that supports three user roles: Admin, Seller, and Buyer.

    Sellers can upload and manage their products.
    Buyers can browse and purchase products, now displayed in a responsive grid layout for better organization.
    Admins oversee the platform and manage users.

The platform integrates multiple payment methods (Bank, Credit Card, PayPal, Stripe, M-Pesa) for seamless transactions.

Built with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a structured marketplace with secure authentication and role-based access control. ðŸš€
